## About

I am a programming language researcher interested in languages, compilers, functional
programming, static and dynamic optimisations and type systems. I live in Uppsala
with my lovely wife and my 2-year old son, Kai.

Below, you can find work-related information regarding my research interests,
publications, teaching and community service.

### Dedication to Scienfic Excellence

- **Two Best Paper Awards.** Scholarly articles on which I am the main author have
been recognised with two best paper awards at the conferences COORDINATION 2018
and DisCoTec 2018 – the latter representing the Best Paper award of the series
of conferences within DisCoTec in the year 2018 (http://www.it.uu.se/about
us/awards).

- **Scholarly Output.** In my 4 years of study since joining
Uppsala University, I have 5 publications that range from recognised conferences
in my field, to journals and an educational symposium on the design of a
software design course. I also have publications which are not co-authored by my
adviser.

### Dedication to Teaching Excellence

- **Head Teacher for Advanced Course.** Going above and beyond the teaching duties
normally expected from a PhD student, I am the head teacher for an entire course
(Advanced Software Design (ASD), with ~80 students yearly). This arrangement has
been ongoing since 2016.

- **Improving Student Satisfaction.** Following my taking on, and updating the ASD
course, the overall satisfaction of students increased (based on course
evaluations) taking the course from a mean of 2.6 (and median of 3) before I
took on the course, to a mean of 3.9 (and median of 4.0).

- **Didactic Science and Collaboration Across Faculties.** During the academic year
2017/18, I introduced a gamification element in the ASD course. This led to a
didactic publication outside of my main research area and was done in
collaboration with the department of Business Studies. The work was published at
EduSymp'18 Symposium (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3270112.3270118).

- **International Visibility for Teaching at Uppsala.** Following the acceptance of
the EduSymp'18 article, I was awarded a MINT (Centrum för ÄmnesdidaktiskForskning inom
Matematik, Ingenjörsvetenskap, Naturvetenskap och Teknikvetenskap) to be able
to attend the conference and present the work to an international community
(http://www.it.uu.se/about us/awards).

### Dedication to the Scientific and Student Communities at Uppsala and Internationally

My community service expands to areas wider than my research and can have an important societal value, if not at
 least at the student level.

- **Promotion of Gender Equality.** I have been the vice-chair of the ACM-W
student chapter at Uppsala University for the last 3 years, promoting gender
equality. As part of this activity, we successfully got a 6000 $ grant from
Microsoft, to continue promoting gender equality at Uppsala University. This led
to the organisation of the Ada Lovelace celebration in 2017, where we brought
international speakers and researchers to promote gender equality
(http://uu.acm.org). We also successfully got a 30 000 SEK scholarship from ID24
to promote gender equality.

- **Conference Volunteer Work.** I am currently serving as publicity chair for
  the DisCoTec conferences (http://www.discotec.org/2019/#organising-committee).

- **Advocating for Privacy.** I am part of a student chapter in Uppsala that
promotes privacy and security technologies, ranging from topics such as email
encryption to how to surf the web safely.

### Other

- **Promotion of Open Source Technology.** I write articles at opensource.com
  (https://opensource.com/users/kikofernandez). These articles are always posted
  also in different student channels to promote open source technology among
  students at Uppsala University.

- **Bridging the Gap between Industry and Academia.** As part of promoting the
open source technologies, I was accepted to an industry conference,
PartialConf’18, where I explained how we have built the open source compiler for
the language Encore, developed at Uppsala University (Partial’18 in Sofia,
http://partialconf.com/lineup#kiko-fernandez).
