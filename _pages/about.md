## **August 2018**

* Paper submitted to EduSymp'18 has been accepted. The abstract is written below:

  > An achievement-driven methodology strives to give students more control of their
  > learning with enough  exibility to engage them in deeper learning.
  >
  > We observed in the course Advanced Software Design, which uses the achievement-driven methodology,
  > that students fail to get high grades, which may hamper deeper learning.
  > To motivate students to pursue and get higher grades we added gamication elements to the course.
  >
  > To measure the success of our gamication implementation, students  filled out a
  > form rating the enjoyment and motivation produced by the game. We built a statistical
  > regression model where enjoyment and motivation explain 55% of the variation in grades.
  > However, only the relationship between "Motivation" and "Grade" is significant,
  > which implies that "Motivation" drives the overall effect of the model. The results
  > suggest that the more the students were motivated by the game, the higher their
  > grades on the course (and vice versa). This implies that if gamication indeed motivates students, then
  > it makes them go beyond what is expected.

* Send an abstract to Partial Conf 2018.

#### **July 2018**

* My proposed presentation to LambdaWorld'18 Cadiz was rejected.

* I submitted the gamification approach that we took during the course Advanced Software Desgin
  to [EduSymp'18](http://www.edusymp.org/2018/). It was the first time that I have
  worked with [Janina Hornbach](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N14-1034),
  it was really fun and I am really happy with the result. Hopefully,
  we will be able to carry on the future work of the paper :)

  The abstract can be found below
  (and the paper will be available once we know if it got accepted):

  > An achievement-driven methodology strives to give some degree of control of the students' learning with enough flexibility to engage them in deeper learning.
  >
  > We observed that, in the course Advanced Software Design, students fail to get high grades and, in turn, deeper learning.
  > To motivate students to pursue and get higher grades we added gamification elements to the course.
  >
  > To measure the success of our gamification implementation,
  > students filled out a form rating the enjoyment and motivation produced by the game.
  > We built a statistical regression model where enjoyment and motivation explain 55\% of the variation in grades.
  > However, only the relationship between "Motivation" and "Grade" is significant, which implies that "Motivation" drives the overall effect of the model.
  > The results suggest that the more the students were motivated by the game, the higher their grades on the course.
  > This implies that gamification indeed motivates students and makes students go beyond what is expected.

#### **June 2018**

* I had a meeting with Anna Eckerdal and got feedback on an educational paper
that uses an opt-in gamification approach. <!--                                            If we manage to submit to [EduSymp](http://www.edusymp.org/2018/), -->
<!-- [MINT](http://mint.uu.se/) (scholarships and grants managed by Anna Eckerdal) -->
<!-- could give me a grant to cover the symposium and travel costs. -->

* Our team ([Dave Clarke](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davcl820),
  [Elias Castegren](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/elica697),
  [Phuc Vo](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/voph710) and
  [me](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/frafe664)) received
  best COORDINATION 2018 paper and best DisCoTec 2018 paper award.

* I will be the new publicity chair for DisCoTec 2019.

* My proposed presentation to ClojuTRE'18 was rejected. My abstract can be found below:

> **Monoids and Monads: The secret weapon to a parallel abstraction**
>
> Why should you consider monoids when designing a parallel abstraction?
> Why monads play an important role in this setting?
> What are the benefits of using monoids and monads?
>
> In this talk, I will save you from creating a non-composable and non-parallelisable library design. To do this, I will show you why your next parallel abstraction is going to use monoids and monads, drawing examples from the (experimental) library ParT. ParT is a functional parallel abstraction that allows the developer to create and coordinate complex parallel workflows, such as asynchronous pipelines of (possibly speculative) parallel computations.
> Join me and let's ParT with monoids and monads!

#### **May 2018**

* The paper *Forward to a Promising Future* has been accepted to COORDINATION and has received the *Best conference paper* award.

* Submission of talk to clojuTRE'18 where I would like to present the functional abstraction *ParT* to the nordic Clojure community.

* Submission of talk to LambdaWorld'18 (Cádiz) where I would like to present the importance of monoidal and monad structures when designing a parallel abstraction.

#### **March 2018**

* Poster presentation of our work *Motivating students with Opt-in gamification* at TUK'18 in Uppsala. We present the opt-in gamification methodology used in the course *Advanced Software Design*. It lead to interesting discussions with professors from other engineering areas. [Poster link here.](public/papers/TUK18Poster.pdf)

#### **February 2018**

* Submission of the paper *Forward to a Promising Future* to COORDINATION.

#### **November 2017**

* The paper *A Survey of Active Object Languages* has been published at the
ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) journal. This was a great effort from leading researchers working in active objects languages. We provide an overview of different active object languages and compare and contrast their differences.


#### **September 2017**

* Presentation of the work *Affine Killing (extended abstract*) at TyDe'17. This paper extends previous work on the functional abstraction ParT and sketches a solution to the problem of stopping asynchronous parallel speculative tasks in the ParT abstraction.
