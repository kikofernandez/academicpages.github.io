## **June 2018**

* Our team ([Dave Clarke](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davcl820),
  [Elias Castegren](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/elica697),
  [Phuc Vo](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/voph710) and
  [me](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/frafe664)) received
  best COORDINATION 2018 paper and best DisCoTec 2018 paper award.

* I will be the new publicity chair for DisCoTec 2019.

* My proposed presentation to ClojuTRE'18 was rejected. My abstract can be found below:

> **Monoids and Monads: The secret weapon to a parallel abstraction**
>
> Why should you consider monoids when designing a parallel abstraction?
> Why monads play an important role in this setting?
> What are the benefits of using monoids and monads?
>
> In this talk, I will save you from creating a non-composable and non-parallelisable library design. To do this, I will show you why your next parallel abstraction is going to use monoids and monads, drawing examples from the (experimental) library ParT. ParT is a functional parallel abstraction that allows the developer to create and coordinate complex parallel workflows, such as asynchronous pipelines of (possibly speculative) parallel computations.
> Join me and let's ParT with monoids and monads!

#### **May 2018**

* The paper *Forward to a Promising Future* has been accepted to COORDINATION and has received the *Best conference paper* award.

* Submission of talk to clojuTRE'18 where I would like to present the functional abstraction *ParT* to the nordic Clojure community.

* Submission of talk to LambdaWorld'18 (Cádiz) where I would like to present the importance of monoidal and monad structures when designing a parallel abstraction.

#### **March 2018**

* Poster presentation of our work *Motivating students with Opt-in gamification* at TUK'18 in Uppsala. We present the opt-in gamification methodology used in the course *Advanced Software Design*. It lead to interesting discussions with professors from other engineering areas. [Poster link here.](public/papers/TUK18Poster.pdf)

#### **February 2018**

* Submission of the paper *Forward to a Promising Future* to COORDINATION.

#### **November 2017**

* The paper *A Survey of Active Object Languages* has been published at the
ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) journal. This was a great effort from leading researchers working in active objects languages. We provide an overview of different active object languages and compare and contrast their differences.


#### **September 2017**

* Presentation of the work *Affine Killing (extended abstract*) at TyDe'17. This paper extends previous work on the functional abstraction ParT and sketches a solution to the problem of stopping asynchronous parallel speculative tasks in the ParT abstraction.
